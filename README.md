# RA_Assignment

Run main.py to utilize this program. There are three methods of operation. 

Load file willl display an image using the data from a .csv file. This is mainly for testing.

Elliptical arcs will create an image of elliptical arcs (non-intersecting unless minimum separation is given as negative). It does not calculate the curvature of these arcs but keeps all of the arcs information.

Circular arcs will create an image of elliptical arcs (non-intersecting unless minimum separation is given as negative). It does not calculate the curvature of these arcs but keeps all of the arcs information.

Images and spreadsheet of info will be saved to a folder called "hairTests" in the directory that you place this folder. The file names are based on current date and time.
